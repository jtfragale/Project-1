# Project 1

## Description
This project is a simple Trivia game. The player gets one point for every correct answer. The user is first asked to enter their name. After the start button is pushed, the game will begin. 
 

Unsolved Problems:

I would eventually like the game to move to the next question even if the wrong answer is selected.
